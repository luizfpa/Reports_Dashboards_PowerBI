# 📊 Power BI Practice Repository – Reports & Dashboards

Welcome to my **Power BI Practice Repository** 🖥️! This repo contains a collection of reports and dashboards I’ve created to practice and enhance my skills in **Microsoft Power BI**. The focus is on experimenting with formulas, measures, data modeling, and visualizations using various datasets.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for learning and improving my Power BI skills. It includes projects like the **Formula 1 Dashboard**, **HR Employee Dashboard**, **Personal Trainer Dashboard**, and **Sales Basic Report**, where I explore different datasets to build interactive reports and dashboards. Each project helps me practice key concepts such as DAX formulas, data transformations, and dashboard design.

### Featured Projects
- **F1_dashboard** 🏎️: Analyzes Formula 1 data across teams, races, and drivers. 
- **HR_Employee** 👥: Focuses on employee data, such as performance, demographics, and HR metrics.
- **Personal_Trainer** 💪: Tracks fitness-related metrics for a personal trainer, like client progress and session data.
- **Sales_Basic_Report** 💰: A basic sales report visualizing revenue, top clients, and trends over time.

## 🛠️ Purpose & Learning Goals

I created this repository to:

- Practice writing **DAX formulas** and measures 📝 (e.g., `Total Points = SUM(Results[points])`)
- Experiment with **data modeling** 🗄️ (e.g., creating relationships between tables like `Races`, `Teams`, and `Results`)
- Build **interactive visualizations** 📈 (e.g., slicers, line charts, bar charts)
- Improve **dashboard design** 🎨 (e.g., custom themes, layouts, and branding)
- Explore **data transformation** using Power Query 🧹 (e.g., cleaning and shaping datasets)
- Learn to derive actionable insights from data 🔎 (e.g., podiums, victories, and points trends)

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **/F1_dashboard** 🏎️: Contains the `.pbix` file and README for the Formula 1 Dashboard project.
- **/HR_Employee** 👥: Contains the `.pbix` file for the HR Employee Dashboard.
- **/Personal_Trainer** 💪: Contains the `.pbix` file for the Personal Trainer Dashboard.
- **/Sales_Basic_Report** 💰: Contains the `.pbix` file for the Sales Basic Report.
- **README.md** 📜: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## 🖥️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**: For creating reports and dashboards 💻
- **Datasets**: Various sources like the Ergast API (for F1 data), mock datasets, or publicly available data 📦
- **DAX**: For creating measures and calculated columns 📊
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation 🧹

## 📁 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `/F1_dashboard`, `/HR_Employee`) and open the `.pbix` file with Power BI Desktop 💻  
3. Explore the visuals, filters, and measures 🔍  
4. Check the corresponding README (if available) in the project folder for more details 📜  
5. Modify the dashboards or use them as a base for your own practice! 🛠️  

## 🌟 Future Plans

- Add more dashboards with different datasets (e.g., finance, marketing, healthcare) 📈  
- Experiment with advanced DAX calculations and time intelligence functions ⏳  
- Incorporate Power BI’s AI features (e.g., key influencers, Q&A) 🤖  
- Share tips and lessons learned from each project 📝
